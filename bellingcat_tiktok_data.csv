bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7294060060580285702.mp4,116," Best part about moving out is you get to choose all the decorations and no one can say anything. I have always wanted a pink themed bathroom. So the first thing I did was change the walls because I did not like this color that was going on. Going with white was the right decision because it just gave it such a clean, open feeling. I am not the best painter whatsoever so I did have to scrub a lot off the sink. But it's okay because everything was due for a good cleaning anyways. How cute is this soap dispenser? It came in a set off of Amazon. Kind of hard finding pink accessories actually. Took me quite a while to collect all these items you see in the video. This shelf unit is so cute. It actually came with the apartment. I decided to make a pink box just filled with like random pink items. Philosophy Body Care has been my newest obsession. They're so pretty and pink and like I don't even want to use them but they smell so good. Everything else you see here probably came from Amazon. And then I had to start scrubbing the floors. It took a while but we did it. I made sure I disinfected everything. The tub was a literal mission to scrub. I added this really cute pink shower mat that I got off of Amazon. This shower caddy is from Walmart by the way. Favorite high end shampoo and conditioner at the moment is the Amika Mirror Ball line. Scalp scrubbers are a game changer. Do not buy shower caps from the dollar store. I threw this out a few days later. I got a new one. You guys will see in the end but now it's time to put on the curtains. I'm obsessed with the ones that I chose. I got them off of Amazon. I got these adorable artworks from the thrift store. High maintenance? You say it like it's a bad thing. Just putting down the rest of my accessories. This was so satisfying for me. And the mats are also from Amazon. This little towel holder came with the apartment as well. It was just so cute I had to keep it. Towels are from Amazon as well. The final result is actually a few months lived in so you'll see it's a little bit different. But I am obsessed with my washroom. Everything about it I just... I love it. It's pink, it's girly, it's me. Anyone who comes over is immediately obsessed with my washroom. Ah and there's a new shower cap I got. This one actually fits all of my hair. And that's actually a traced painting I did years ago of Barbie. I'm extremely satisfied."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7212363043479620906.mp4,147," 10 things I no longer use now that I'm in my 30s. I stopped using tampons a while ago. I now use these L pads. I just feel like they're much better. You know, you let it flow freely. Nothing is stopping it. So that's just my personal preference. I no longer use Vagisil for down there. Instead, I use Dove. And although this might be controversial, this is what works for me. I stopped using women's razors because of pink tacks and now I use men's razors. And this is the one I pretty much get, the five blade reusable razors from Gillette. Or you can get the generic version. Back in the day, I used to use the loofah, but I figured that a rag is the best way to really exfoliate and get all that gunk out of your skin. So trust me when I say the rag is it. After finding out that makeup wipes are actually really bad for your skin, they irritate the skin, they make it dry. I started using a cleansing balm and the one that I really like is this Elf one. It is so buttery. It takes off all your makeup and it's really soothing. So for my hair, I feel like my hair has gotten so much healthier since I started using actual microfiber hair towels like this one instead of your regular shower towel. So that's exactly what I do and look how long and shiny and healthy it looks. I stopped using regular deodorant and I started using a more natural paraben-free, aluminum-free native deodorant. And as you know, when you actually start using natural deodorant, you might start smelling a little bit more. So what I do to kill that bacteria, which was a hack that one of my girlfriends gave me, was using the Panaxo. This is really good for when you're in the shower, you rub it under your armpits and it literally gets rid of the bacteria that causes the odor so that then you can start using natural deodorant and it doesn't smell bad. Number eight, I actually had really bad acne and I was using all types of face washes to see what would get rid of my blemishes, the pimples, the comedones, blackheads, whiteheads, and nothing worked. With the exception of this Asepsia bar soap, this has been a lifesaver. Look at my skin now. I used to use Listerine for oral care because that's what my mom always used. And when I discovered Fairbreath, I have not looked back. This is such a game changer. Definitely recommend. Last but not least, I stopped using bras because I have a boob job and who needs a bra when you have perky boobs? No, but seriously, I just don't like bras and I just think that you're just so free when you don't have them. So yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you want a part two, let me know."

But then I really got to thinking and I realized, he's being a little too sweet, a little too nice. It makes you wonder, what is really going on in his head?

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/6847141541354458374.mp4,52," Here are my five must-have bras from Amazon. Number one is this LISA push-up bra. When I worked at Victoria's Secret, I had girls come in every single day and ask me what bra is going to hold up my girls together and push them up. For the price and the result of this bra, I think every girl needs to have one of these in their wardrobe. The padding is in the shape of a hand, which I feel like helps lift and scoop and bring the girls together. Here's a before and after. Number two is the Ultimate Comfy bralette by Hanes. I love this one. It's so good. It makes me feel like I'm not wearing a bra at all, but if you have a larger chest and you want thicker straps, I recommend this one by Warners. I tie-dyed mine and I love the way it looks. Number four is this multi-way strapless convertible bra. It has a fairly inclusive shade range and because the cup is full coverage, it literally does not fall down. And lastly, it's this sports bra tank top. I am so impressed with the quality, the fit, and the support of this sports bra. I highly recommend this style, especially for my larger chested ladies, if you like the sports bra look and want the support. Thanks for watching!"

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7317835736382754078.mp4,114," So this is the before and then this is the after of my brother's bathroom So here's part three of me decorating my brother's apartment. He has this loft. So today we're doing the bedroom area We're only gonna do the part around the bed He has this IKEA bed frame that has doors at the bottom and he wants to keep it because he keeps a lot of his Clothes in there, which is smart So what we're gonna do we're gonna add something to the back because it looks very bare a little trick instead of buying a whole New bed you just get a new headboard. So we found this one at Urban Outfitters And it's so cute watch and honestly buying just a headboard is way cheaper than buying a whole new bed frame because beds are Expensive y'all but look at this headboard You just attach it to the wall with this little hook in the back and this piece of wood and look I'm just gonna place It here and it transformed the bed so much. I was so excited to put it up I just had to get to measuring leveling and get my screwdriver gun I know it's a drill y'all. But anyway, I had to use draw what anchors over here as well I actually use this tape hack on my guest bedroom series and it helps so much with getting the holes in the correct spot Then all you need is the drill and then the screws and this thing is so easy to put up you basically just screw this Wood piece into the wall make sure it's leveled and then this little back piece of the headboard hooks right on top of it It has like an angle to where you just kind of place it on top and then it just fits right in there and look At that easy and it literally transformed the bed so much It looks like you just got a brand new bed and then my brother was telling me that this window right here The Sun comes through while he's sleeping. It's super bright and then sometimes it falls down up here So we had to do blackout curtains and also a curtain track Okay, if you haven't heard a curtain track is way better than a curtain rod. I have pleated curtains So I'm taking this little hook part off and we're just gonna place all these little hooks in and then you have a whole Curtain track that easy I get this from Amazon Everything's linked in my storefront by the way But I measured it to where it's gonna fit all the way across this way So no light peeks through and then there's holes that you just screw it to the ceiling It's literally so easy and I'm telling you it looks so much better when the curtains are on So like I said before we got blackout curtains, we got the color black and then these ones are also pleated I love pleated curtains on this curtain track and it comes with the hook already I also made sure to get shorter curtains So they weren't touching the bed and then you use these pleated curtain hooks to hook it to the track and if you can still See the track you have to get the little hook So this is the hook that you can buy separately and then you put it in the middle But this one just came with it You push this hook part down and you can take it off and readjust So you want to make sure that hook is closer to the bottom so that the curtain is as close to the ceiling as possible And it covers the track now. I just love this look way better than a curtain rod I know the curtains need to be ironed We're gonna steam them but you see like when he wants light he can move them over to the sides and they're away from the Window when he wants it dark. He could just close them all the way now for the bed. We have black sheets Don't worry. It's not a black and white house. Okay, my brother likes black, but we're gonna add a pop of color So we're gonna do blue for the bed We got this blue comforter from Urban Outfitters and I just love the color how bright and vibrant it is Just went ahead and tucked in those ends and then now we got some new pillows, but this pillow is really cool It's called the original coco pillow. It's one part cool and one part cozy So I was shocked when I opened it because I've never actually tried one This side is cozy and this side is cold like Reggie literally screaming because it felt ice cold and it wasn't even cold in this House, honestly, I need it for myself now, but look here's a close-up. So this side is cool It's like broken up memory foam inside and this side is cozy. So it's like a velvet material. We got two of them They were flat because they were packed airtight. So I was over here fighting them trying to get them a little bit more fluffy They're gonna expand more but I just needed them a little more fluffy to go in the pillowcases Then I just got two more pillows from Amazon We're gonna put four pillows on the bed with black and blue pillowcases Then I had to get a little decorative throw blanket one sides checkered on one side's nice and cozy I went ahead and hung that off the side of the bed at the angle and it's already looking so much better But we're not done. We have some art to put up So come back for part four to see what we decide to put up because we got options"

It has places to keep a calendar or just write regular notes and you write in it like you would in a normal notebook then it comes with this cloth that you get wet and it can erase all of your notes so that you can reuse the notebook over and over. Then using the app you can scan and upload your notes or page to your computer so you can keep everything in different categories and digitize all of your notes and you can decide which platform you want to upload it to. And lastly is this mesh laundry basket that has a side pocket for your laundry detergent, dryer sheets, and it has multiple carrying handles."

Day of I made sure to get myself ready bright and early because if I didn't there would be no time later. We did everything in sections and we started with the front. Cones, caution banners, the DIY sign and a balloon garland. Super simple but it looked so good. I needed to get the cakes done early because I just like for them to set a little bit. You do not have to be Betty Crocker you guys this was so easy and so cheap. The cakes are from Walmart. I took the frosting off and re-frosted it with whipped vanilla frosting. Threw on some Oreo crumbles in a truck and called it a day. The entertainment center held all the gifts. Added the sign and banner to tie it all together. Crapped the dirt cups this was just chocolate pudding and Oreo crumbles. Okay the activities were by far my favorite part of the entire party. I just wanted the kids to have fun and be wild. The lumber yard was literally just Amazon boxes wrapped up. Hammer away was the next one. These little green things were a mess. I'm pretty sure they're for flowers but they worked well for the occasion. Little green things, golf tees and tiny hammers. This activity was a hit. Next up was traffic cone ring toss. Again super simple super cheap. Cones and rings. What do you need? I did spray paint some of the rings because I'm crazy and I wanted them to match. Very unnecessary but it took three seconds with a can of spray paint. This is what they saw when they first walked in. Welcome builders report to Linux Saint for duty. Melt me. I got these hats and they came with vest on Amazon. Honestly almost everything is from Amazon or Walmart or Dollar Tree. I made the rack out of PVC pipe and called it a day.

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7357823540600507690.mp4,139," My twin boys are so freaking different, but one thing they do have in common is their love for pizza. So for their 12th birthday, I'm throwing them a not so ordinary, ridiculously cheesy pizza party. We are expecting horrible rain in the forecast, so I gotta get a little creative here. I spent all last night DIYing a balloon garland, so starting out the day with some blisters on my fingers, but seven hours before the party starts, I'm gonna start by decorating the main table. I actually realized how much I needed last minute and Instacarted a massive order from Costco. So freaking grateful for you Instacart heroes out there. So I brought that in, and even though the weather is gonna be horrendous, we did attempt to cover the patio so I can put a little bit of decor out here. I got this backdrop off of Amazon, the tablecloths are my favorite because they wrap around the tables and they don't fly off in the wind. Tends to get windy this time of year. Plus they're washable, and I got this checkered table runner to bring it all together. This massive seven and a half foot round backdrop has been one of my favorites to use lately. I got a red cover for it and blew up some balloons that say slice, slice baby. I'm so obsessed with this theme. Back inside, I'm temporarily moving my puppy setup into another room, just so that we have more sitting space indoors to get out of the bad weather. But halfway through that, the bad weather got offended and completely blew off the tart we had covering the patio. So I lost my husband's help for literally the rest of the day while he and my son attempted to fix this for the next several hours. Things are not going well five hours before the party starts and now we're wiping down the tables, bringing them indoors, more tablecloth, not me manhandling this balloon garland. I don't know how everyone makes this look so easy, it really wasn't. I will say there are way more cute pizza party themed things on the internet than I was expecting. Like this love you two pizza sign, how cute is that? This LED pizza light, perfect for the table decor. About three hours before the party starts now and it's time to act like I'm a Pinterest mom. I found the cutest dessert ideas on there. Now I'm not claiming that they're the most delicious, but creative for sure, so bear with me. I'm turning these ding dongs into pasta meatballs with the plastic forks, some hardening chocolate and frosting, then I got these shortcake shells and literally just filled them with frosting to make them look like a pizza. It looked cute, okay. My best friend coming in clutch though with the real actually good dessert of the party. The cake, baby. Shout out to Saveway, they nailed our two pizza cakes for the birthday boys. I do get each of my twins their own cake, they also get their own birthday song. Just because they're twins and share a birthday doesn't mean they have to share everything, okay? But anyway, I got a bunch of those gummy pizzas, I didn't put a slice on top of each of the cupcakes. About an hour before the party starts now and I'm warming up a few of the side dishes, but obviously the main course today is gonna be pizza. You guessed it, so we ordered a crap ton from the best local pizzeria in town, it's called Pizza Bell. If you haven't tried it, you are seriously missing out because honey, you can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza. So I ordered a bunch of big daddies with some salads and breadsticks. I also ordered these custom coloring papers, the Ste. Kyson and Cadence pizzeria, and voila. The most insane pizza party is complete. This is probably one of my most favorite, unique party themes we've done to date. Everything came out better than expected to celebrate my double trouble tweenagers."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7209680620362927403.mp4,90," I've been wanting a white KitchenAid for so long. When my husband and I got married, his grandma gave us this KitchenAid mixer, and it's a professional version. It works amazing. So I just couldn't justify getting rid of it just because of the color. So I decided on a whim that I wanted to try to paint it. I started by taking it all the way apart and scrubbing it down with Dawn and degreaser super well. Now for the really scary part, which is sanding, if you have a friend, definitely grab them because that makes this process go by so much faster. So I'm sanding, but if you can see these little scales, I'm basically just trying to sand until most of that is gone. The gloss, my husband's using the electric sander outside, but I'm going over spots that you couldn't get with that sander. Yeah, there was no going back from here. We taped off everything we didn't want painted, and if you like the pearl white color, here's what we used. You could take a screenshot. I tried to do thin, even layers of white, and I will say because it was such a dark blue, it took about three layers to get it completely white. We did give it like a day in between each coat just to let it cure. We used a really high grit sandpaper on any imperfections to make sure this was totally smooth before we put the machine back together and applied the pearl. If you see any little paint spots that bug you, you can use that 5000 sandpaper just to smooth those out. I definitely think that the professional line of this mixer is a lot harder to paint because you have to take it apart, put it back together, whereas the tilt one would be so much easier. We added several coats of high gloss clear. I gave it time to cure in between each coat, and then I literally let it sit in my garage for like a week before I brought it back in. We added all the pieces back together, and I cannot believe how good it turned out. I'm so happy with it. I've used it a lot since I painted it, and it has been so great. I'm so happy with how it looks in my kitchen now. It's hard to believe it used to be blue."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7166704190851468586.mp4,174," I'm an Amazon delivery driver and if you order from Amazon this message is gonna be for you because we need to talk. I'm gonna be giving you some tips and behind the scenes things that you may not have known in order to help you, help us help you. Number one, we can start as early as 3 a.m. And we could go until about 11 30 p.m. Depending on the shift. So don't assume that your delivery is being handled during daylight hours. Assume that it's not. Put your porch light on. Please put your- I'm tripping over things. We're struggling out there. Number two, and just as an example the warehouse that I deliver from employs over 2,000 delivery drivers. Between the DSP drivers and ones that are in the trucks and the vans and the flex drivers and ones driving their own car. There's over 2,000 of us and we don't have the same route. It's not like USPS. It's not like your mail carrier, right? Every time that we go into work, who knows we're gonna be driving that day. My station, I can be a Delaware, PA, Jersey or Maryland at any given time. We don't have a set route. That's not how that works. And I'm saying this because you know the delivery instructions that you can write down when you go to check out. Let's talk about those. A couple things there. Number one, whatever you write down is we're gonna see that every single time. Unless you erase it or update it. And I'm saying this it's really important because last week, for example, I was driving, delivery instruction said bright red door can't miss it. Door was black. I missed it. I may have turned around and found it, but I was looking for a bright red door. I don't know how old that message was. Update your shit. The second part is do not use delivery instructions as a way to send a personal message to your last delivery driver. I guarantee they'll never see it. They'll never see it. So this morning when I took a delivery just as another example, it said as a delivery instruction, it said, I don't know why you're so confused. You just delivered to my neighbor yesterday. No, Susan, I did not. In fact, I've never been in this neighborhood before. So don't use it as a personal message because they're not getting it. Speaking of delivery instructions, we're supposed to knock on the door between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. So if you don't want us to, write that down in your delivery instructions. Please do not knock on the door. Don't come out mad at us yelling at us when we do it. We didn't know. We're supposed to. Now I won't knock on the door for a couple of circumstances. If I know that I'm delivering diapers, I'm just gonna assume there's a sleeping baby. I won't knock. Where if I see very young child toys in the yard, I won't knock them either. Number four, big heads up, the only ones that are allowed to deliver inside your mailbox is the United States Postal Service. They consider it piece of federal property. We're not allowed to deliver into it. It is illegal. So I don't care if your delivery instruction says delivered a mailbox. I will not be doing that. If we get caught, Amazon can be fined up to $10,000 and I could possibly lose my job. Your plushie is not worth it. There's so much more. We really didn't get to the good stuff yet. So make sure you're following for part two."

The cover acts as a cutting board and I love that it has a built-in trash you can pull out. There are honestly so many cool features and it makes it really convenient for us throughout the week.

All you have to do is fill it with baking soda and it keeps your fridge smelling great. This is portable hand soap, which come in these cool strips and they dissolve once you put them in water. This is a cord organizer bag and it allows you to store 15 different chargers. These are appliance wheels, which make it easy to move appliances on the counter. This is a luggage scale that shows you the exact weight of your bag. This is an inflatable travel pillow that fits in this tiny bag.

It's usually a pretty time-consuming task, especially with the other items they want me to clean in their rooms as well. So I was really excited when I found out about this new makeup brush cleaner. You simply dip your brushes about a quarter of the way into the solution, and then all the dirt, grime, and makeup just wipes right off onto a clean towel. I was amazed at what an easy process it was and how thoroughly it cleaned the brushes. Once I was certain every brush was clean to my daughter's standards, I laid them out so they could completely dry and be ready for them to use in the morning."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7348144268336303406.mp4,53," After a good amount of research, I found a round swivel chair on Amazon that I love. I wanted a big comfy chair that I can sink into when reading, working, and watching TV. A bunch of the ones that I found were over $2,000, which is crazy. I also found one from Ashley Furniture, which was nice and a little cheaper. This one came with the ottoman and cost less than that one. The ottoman is really cool because it's shaped to fit right up to the couch, almost extending it, and it has storage inside of it. This couch had really good reviews and they allowed for returns if I hated it. So I went for it and I'm so glad that I did. Something to keep in mind is that the box that it comes in is huge and very heavy, so I did pay an extra $20 for the delivery team to bring it upstairs to the room. There was no way I was going to be able to do that by myself. But after that, as you can see, it was very easy to put together. And look how cute it is, especially with the little ottoman up against it. This is now my new favorite place to sit in my house. So yeah, I'm in love with this couch and I did buy it with my own money. It is not a sponsored review."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7196004257923960070.mp4,77," Is a king-size mattress in a box from Amazon any good? And is it worth the money? We're about to find out. Listen, honestly I'm super skeptical. The last bed we own, a king-size, cost us like $13-1400. It was great. It was a huge brand name. So how is this thing in a box gonna compare? Over 4500 reviews, 4.5 stars, $599 for a king-size 12-inch bed. Let's see how this goes. So this is the box. It's maybe 4.5 feet tall at most, maybe a couple feet wide. It's not big. It's heavy, about 100 pounds. But this is it. As soon as you take it out of the box, you can already kind of start to hear it sucking in air. This whole thing has been vacuum sealed. Even before we opened it, it's already starting to take shape. So now you have to cut it out of the packaging using a special cutter that they send with the mattress. And then you have to unfold it. And there you see it fits right on the king-size box. And very quickly, this is 24 hours after opening, it's becoming a mattress. We're gonna leave it for 72 hours and see how it goes."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7244283220475546926.mp4,68," 6 Shark Tank Products I Use Every Day First up is this safety nail holder that Mark Rohan and Laurie invested in. It stops you from hitting your hand while hammering and it's crazy how magnetic it is. It's easy to hold and honestly couldn't be easier to use. Laurie invested $300,000 on this one and for good reason, because it literally saves lives. It fits perfectly around your seatbelt holder and it's pretty easy to fit snug into place. I tested it with my phone, keys, and some coins and it holds all of them perfectly so they don't fall down. This one had two sharks as investors and it's the snacking tool of the future. It looks a little strange but it fits comfortably on your two fingers, allowing you to eat snacks and keep your fingers clean when typing, playing video games, and more. Damon bought 100% of this company on Shark Tank. This car doorstep fits into the hook of your car door and it's strong enough to hold 400 pounds so you can easily put cargo bags, skis, and more on top of your car. This is another one Laurie invested in. These silicone fur zappers remove fur from clothes when washing and drying them. I tested it with clothes with a ton of fur here. They caught a lot of hair after washing and even more after the dry cycle finished and they also helped bring more hair to the link catcher and left very little on my clothes. The final product is another one Laurie invested in. Drink spiking is unfortunately very common and this is the best reusable solution. It's a scrunchie for your wrist that unfolds into a drink cover ready to be pulled out whenever you need it."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7370060678251679022.mp4,91," Babe, hot girl cardinal rule number one, the uglier you go to bed, the hotter you'll wake up. Let me show you how I do it. First things first, moisturizer. Your skin literally gets so dry when you sleep. Super important to overcompensate for that. And moisturize so that you're not producing excess oils. Then I will take some Aquaphor and slug my skin. I swear by this step. You're just gonna take about a pea-sized amount and then rub it all over your face. It's been an absolute game changer in my skin's overall appearance. Another key skin part, my Gua Sha. Literally live, laugh, love my Gua Sha. She's an icon. I love her. Then one of my favorite parts is definitely my heatless curls. Literally a game changer. It saves you so much time in the morning. You're gonna place the rod right in the center. Take a butterfly clip and pin it into place. Then you're gonna kind of French twist it. So you're gonna take a small section, wrap it over the rod, and then pick up another section. Incorporate it in and then wrap that around. Keep repeating that pattern of picking up more hair, incorporating it in the last piece, and then wrapping it further. I always make sure that when I'm picking it up, I'm not pulling it directly to the side, but I'm almost pulling it up. Once you get to the bottom, you're just gonna secure off with a scrunchie. We're gonna repeat that process to the other side. Once both sides are done, I will push up the end of the scrunchie just a little bit so that the curls don't move while I sleep. Literally look like that homegirl from Star Wars. I will just take the ends of this and wrap it around my forehead just to keep everything in place. Now I'm taking my eye cream and I'm gonna take a big glob of this. Pack it underneath my eye. This is one of my favorite eye creams. It is the Kiehl's Creamy Avocado. It works so good. A little kiss on top is this Pixi Patches. Place it right underneath my eye and once it's nice and under, I will just pat it in just to lock in the eye cream. The same to the other side. I know most people place their under eye patches the opposite way, but I saw a girl place it like this and she says it fits under her eyes so much better and I completely agree. And you're gonna take a self tanner and literally contour your face. It will make you look like you are wearing makeup as soon as you wake up in the morning. Amazing. I will just go in little layers and build this up to the depth that I want and then go to bed and when you wake up in the morning it will fully develop. Literally look so chiseled and bronze. Going in with a brow and lash serum is so key. I truly think that they work. If you don't have a lash or brow serum, I recommend using castor oil. Your lashes will be nice and long and full looking. And then you want to make sure you're getting good sleep. So I always pop in a melatonin. This is one of my favorites. It's by Ollie. It's their sleep maximum strength. Literally out like a light. We'll spray my satin pillowcases with this slumber and sleep lavender mist. Smells so good and now my mind immediately associates this scent with sleep. As soon as I spray it, I knock out. And I go in with my $5 facelift. It is literally a little chin strap that pulls up my jaw. Let's hook it over. And then... Botox hoop. Go in with my little Laneige lip sleep mask. This will have you waking up with literally the juiciest, supple, plump looking lips. And then I will pop in my night guard because I grind my teeth like a mother at night. And you don't want to be wearing down your pearly whites. So use night guards so that you can keep them nice and protected. Good night."
bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7325578681496440110.mp4,57," I know you've seen this nail glow. I cannot justify spending $100 every two weeks at the nail salon anymore. I've been seeing this everywhere. It's $5 nail glue off Amazon that is supposed to make your nails last up to 30 days. So I also bought some white French chips off Amazon. Both are linked in my storefront on my Instagram bio if you want them. Let's see if this works. Okay, here they are. They look amazing. They feel very sturdy. I will update you guys. One week later, I am genuinely shocked. I've never had a nail glue last this long. I added a top coat just for some extra protection. I think it looks a lot better top coat honestly. But I'll update you guys in two weeks, I guess but this is crazy. If this isn't enough, I don't know what is."

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7315251087664074014.mp4,191," So this is how my brother's bathroom started. I decorated it to this, but we are not done. So this is part two of decorating my brother's apartment and we are finishing this bathroom. So this apartment doesn't have much storage, so we're putting as much storage as we can. So I got one of these shelves that go over the toilet. These are my favorite type of storage because it's just so much space behind a toilet that's not being used. Like yes, you could put a picture frame there, but no. We're putting storage. So this one specifically has a tension rod, so it has like a little spring at the top. Then you just push up and push the rod all the way back and let me tell you, that thing is secure. Not even kidding, I had to use all my muscle and might just to get it in place. But once it's up, it's up and you can just put the poles however far apart you need them to be because the shelves are adjustable. It actually goes pretty wide. So if you have more room around your toilet, you can actually make the shelf probably double this size. And this one was really easy to put together. So you just screw the sides onto the pole and then if you needed to adjust the height, you can just unscrew it a little bit, move them up and down. So you just customize it to whatever you're gonna put on the shelf, if you're gonna put baskets, towels, whatever, and it looks really cool. And even better, super sturdy. This is not going anywhere. And then there's also these little clear plastic covers to put over so nothing falls through the poles. So there's way more storage here now. And then remember the door? This little hamper shelf wasn't working for the space, so we're gonna use it somewhere else. So I found something else for behind the door. This little pouch thing, you can put so much stuff in it. I don't know how much stuff my brother actually needs to store, but I'd rather put it here than have it cluttered all over the sink. And it's actually really flat against the door, so it's not bothering me when you're standing next to the door closed, so it's perfect. Now back to the toilet shelf, I found these little baskets. You can put whatever in there. And then we're gonna put towels on this shelf. So you see me stacking these all nicely and then look at him coming in and making a mess. I was like, absolutely not, thanks, but no. So after that is all organized, it looks so good. Cause like really, nobody really has towel storage in their bathroom. So this is literally perfect for that. Now time for some art. I found this cassette tape, little piece. My brother loves music, so I was like, oh, this is perfect. And we're using command strips, okay? I put it by the mirror that everybody was so upset about. Like, come on, if you want a round mirror, go buy a round mirror. My brother wanted this one. So that's what he got for his bathroom. Anyway, it looks so good. Also these, I found these on Amazon. It's a little Snoop Dogg dog and a Michael Jackson dog. I thought they were just so funny. I was kinda like, eh, I don't know if he's gonna like these, but he ended up loving them. So we are adding them in here for some pops of color. Like, come on, that's so cute. It's cute for a guy's bathroom or somebody that likes music. So those were the finishing touches. I think the pops of color look great with all of the black. Couldn't leave it looking too plain. And then his dog had to come check it out. He said, auntie, you did a good job. Adding a little flashback. So the bathroom went from this to this. Like, come on, that looks like a guy's bathroom. It's actually really nice. I liked the way it turned out. And then Reggie came to come check it out and he liked it too. He liked it so much. Watch, this is how much he liked it. He started twerking. It can't be a Jasmine and Reggie video without twerking. But y'all, bathroom is done, but we still have a lot to do with the rest of this apartment. So stay tuned for part three coming very, very soon."

He said I could do whatever I want So we're doing that but the only thing is we're doing it on a budget So first up we're starting with the bathroom. The bathroom is actually really nice. It's upgraded It just has some things that need to be upgraded a little more like the shower rod is sitting here rolling not even secure So that's gotta go. So we're starting off with taller longer shower curtains and liners So usually they're at the height of the shower But no, we want to elongate this bathroom and put at the highest point you can it'll make your bathroom Look so much taller, but Reggie has stairs right here. So we have to put it right under there, but that's still taller So it's still gonna look good So I got this double shower curtain rod and it's one of the adjustable ones, but I was struggling I could not get it up so I had to bring out the screwdriver gun cuz Yeah, we're screwing this in I was trying to be renter-friendly when I could but I mean a shower curtain needs to stay up So this is okay and I went I checked to see if there are studs and there was so we don't need drywall anchors Over here, so I screwed those babies in and let me tell you these things are going Nowhere those poles are gonna stay up I got the poles in and tell me why this screwdriver one was so much easier than the adjustable one Like come on now that other one had me sweating So I like the shower curtains with the two poles so you can put the shower liner on the inside and the shower curtain on The outside I just like them on separate poles. It just looks better Um, so I got that one on and then I have black shower curtains and I got two panels and then some black curtain hooks So this one covers the whole thing But I got two because I want them to be on each side and open in the middle. I think it just looks nice But you'll see look at this you go open it from the middle. Like that's just so cute. It looks better next up We're replacing this mirror This mirror is really cute But ready wanted a medicine cabinet to like have more storage and he found this one and I was like, yep, perfect I could put it up I could put anything up and then I had him come in to show me how high he wanted me To put the mirror I had a market so I didn't put it too low Took off this round mirror and look at me y'all I had to measure I had to look for studs and wires I had to put tape down. I had him use a leveler. I'm a whole builder Okay, so there was no studs where this little hook needed to go So I needed to put the drywall anchors in so I did that and these drywall anchors were crucial here because I did not want This mirror tumbling down So this hook was in and that was the main sorcery that was gonna hold this thing up And then I had to mark these two little holes at the top and I had to put drywall anchors in over there, too And boom, okay. So this is the funny part We were trying to get this thing up and I could not screw in the screws So we're like, okay, let's take off the light. Maybe we could do that. I couldn't do it Reggie tried He couldn't do I was like, okay Let me get a screwdriver and then Reggie was like, you know what open the doors and we busted out laughing like no way We struggled that hard and all we had to do was open the doors But anyway after that slow moment the cabinet was up and all I had to do was put the shelves in so there was these Little hooks to put it on the sides and then the shelves were glass and once those are in you can actually fit a whole Bunch of stuff in here. So this is a storage hack If you don't have a lot of storage in your bathroom and now the moment we've all been waiting for Yup, that was satisfying but now it's time for more storage I actually found this slim storage thing from Amazon and it's actually super skinny But it has so many shelves so you can also fit a lot in there and there's wheels on the bottom so you can roll It around you could put hair products. You could put brushes. You can put toilet paper. You could put more towels I don't know you could put a lot on here It doesn't take up a lot of room and as you can see the theme is black So I got black little bathroom accessories like this little trash can and then this little soap dispenser It gotta go because we got a cuter one We filled it up with some more soap and look at that so much cuter and we're trying to maximize space everywhere Okay So I found these little storage things for underneath the sink You can put a whole bunch of stuff on the bottom and on the top and then you has a pull out so you can easily Reach and then the poles are actually adjustable so you can make them taller so you can fit taller products underneath and look at this So now you're not gonna have just storage at the bottom You're gonna have be able to stack it up and then the little bottom part that pulls out is literally Genius because nobody wants to stick their hand back there and knock everything else over and then I saw this and I was like Yeah, Reggie needs this I'm getting this for him It's a toilet brush and a toilet plunger in the shape of cactuses like this one's cute You don't want those ugly plain ones No, and then we found this really cute wall shelf slash hamper from Urban Outfitters Like it's actually a really cute concept an idea, but I do think it's a little too big for this bathroom I think in a bedroom would be a better setting for this because the door doesn't open It's a square small so I'll find something different for the back of this door and now for some colors some pizzazz I found this checkered rug literally love it. It's gonna bring some oomph into here and then this smiley face love this rug It's so cute. But Reggie had to come and check out what was done so far We have some stuff still on the way. So come back for part two because we are not done"

It's a playpen that features a soccer goal at each end with a basketball hoop and I found it off Amazon for a reasonable price. Now just for reference, my son Adam is only 11 months old and he wouldn't understand the sports itself but he has grasped the concept of kicking a ball into a soccer goal, placing a ball into the basketball net and now he's even getting the idea of bouncing the ball. Now obviously they don't just learn this overnight from buying a playpen but it does create that sporting environment that you want your kids to grow up in. And whilst most playpens are used to keep your kid in a safe area, this one serves both purposes with the door option and I found Adam spending more time in there without complaint when the doors open. I guess it feels less like a trap and I'm sure it's apparent you know how messy things get with all the toys around and I like the fact that this playpen acts as some storage.

You're probably right. That ain't my kid though. That really did shatter everywhere. It's kind of plastic-y, but it breaks. You can squeeze it in your hands and it doesn't hurt.

I've only been using this for like a little over a month and I've already seen tremendous hair growth. This light, I'm using it right now. I use it for like almost all my Instagram photos. Like taking photos or making TikTok videos, you need this. This Amino Lean pre-workout, I use this before I go to the gym. I've always been scared of pre-workout but this is like made for women and it doesn't give you any jitters. It's just kind of like having an energy drink. It has health benefits and it's gluten free. Ariana Grande cloud perfume. I discovered it was a dupe for Baccarat this year and I've been wearing it ever since. I love it and I always get so many compliments. It makes any sneaker or slipper look so cute, I love them. This digital camera, I have a few linked but this is the specific one I use.

My favorite hairspray, it works well. It gives you so much volume and it smells really good. I have gone through hundreds of different tripods and this is the only one that has lasted and worked. It's not flimsy, it doesn't break when I travel. It's like rubber on the outside. It goes like really small, it's like really huge. Super easy to work and this is like my favorite by far.

The first time I ever bought one of these was about two years ago, but I just bought a new one, so I thought I'd show you guys because it's surprising how many people don't know this exists. So this is a notebook, it comes with a rag and a special pen, and it is a very high-tech notebook. So it has different symbols that you can put its own label to, and on each page you'll see these symbols at the very bottom. For example, if I was in school I could put math, science, history, English, etc. And then on the page I can put notes, obviously this is math, so I'm going to put an X over the symbol because it goes with the math symbol. There's an app on your phone where you could set a destination for each symbol, for example you could send your math notes to your Google Docs or your email or whatever. On that same app you can scan this entire page and it will notice you put an X over that symbol and automatically send it to the location of your choice. Once you scan the page all you have to do is get the rag wet and it will just wipe away because you have that special pen. And then you can reuse it while still being able to save all of your notes electronically."

This is what my feet look like before and as you can see there's a bit of dry skin on my toe and heel. I started by soaking my feet for 15 minutes and then I put the booties on and secured them with socks and then chilled for 90 minutes. It took about four days before anything happened and I was a little underwhelmed at first but it just got worse and worse until my foot was literally like a snake shedding its skin. I even had to bring in a pair of scissors to cut off the flappy bits with. After a crazy amount of skin had come off I was left with really soft feet so I definitely recommend it and I'm glad I tested it out.

bellingcat-tool/amazonfinds/media/7180423913216773419.mp4,152," So many people have beauty blenders at home and they're using them completely wrong. They're getting results like this and this when they could be getting results like this. I'm Joy, I'm a professional makeup artist. I teach majority of the time in my career now and the number one misconception is that sponges don't work for people when in reality they don't know how to work the sponge. So I'm going to show you today how we got these results using the same sponge, same product, just a different loading technique. We're loading our sponges wrong the same way we are loading brushes wrong. A lot of the time it's the skill you guys, not the product and not the application tool, but us as the user. So my goal is to help you not make these mistakes anymore. We have a fresh paper towel, a sponge, and a good old foundation. I'll go over the first mistakes that people make. One they're picking a sponge that's way too hard. You want something really soft, malleable, with a nice flat surface for foundation. It should be applied wet. This is a dry version of this sponge. It should double in size. That I'm sure you've heard of. First mistake. We're taking our sponge and we're just putting the foundation directly on the sponge and going straight to the face. Let's just say this paper towel is our skin. I know people are going to say it's not. It's for demo purposes so you guys can visualize what's happening on your skin. This part that we started with is drying faster than the part we ended with. So no matter how much we sit there and blend, we're always going to be left with some sort of cakey, uneven canvas. Mistake number two. This one is a little better, but it's not 100% better. We put it on the back of our hand. That's a good start. And then we do that same thing where we tap once or twice up. And now that is what our stamp is going to be on our face. So to be honest, that might even be worse. If you're painting a wall, you wouldn't just dip the roller that you're rolling the wall out with in the paint once. You would saturate the roller and then roll onto the wall. So let's do it the right way. We're going to take our foundation, one pump on the back of our hand, take our sponge, aka stamp, and we're going to load our sponge evenly until every bit of that foundation is evenly into the sponge. You can check it. If there's dots, keep going. Okay, and back to our visual. Give it a try."

And once they get non-sticky, you can just run them underwater and they get sticky again. You can literally wear a pair for like 30 times.

That took like half a minute to drain. Look at that. It sucks. It's kind of hard to see but there's a lot of gunks down there. I use this drain though but as you can see it doesn't work. So I'm going to try the third thing. Apparently you can burn your skin if you're not careful. So that's why I'm wearing gloves right now. I activated it by hot water only so I'm boiling some hot water in my kettle. Oh there's a lot of smoke coming out. Ah gross. Let's see if that helped. Yo the water is draining. It's not building up.

My shaker bottle literally has how to make one. I got this from a tag sale. But you just tap it to turn it on. Then you lift the lid and each drink has a barcode. That's the barcode scanner. So that's how it knows which to pour in. It told me to put a shaker bottle and this is when I used my fancy circle ice cubes. But you can decide how strong you want it. And I chose regular, but look how cool this is. It just comes right out. When it's done, it says cheers and you pour it into a glass.
