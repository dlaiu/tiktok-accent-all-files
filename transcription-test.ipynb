So I soaked my feet for about 15 minutes and put on these booties for 90, and I chilled with some socks on. It really wasn't too uncomfortable, and then I washed off all of the residue. It took about 3-4 days to see any type of peeling, but once it started, it did not stop. I basically had webbed feet. Me and my mom were cracking up when we were removing it, and for the next two days, it just kept getting more and more drastic. At one point, my whole heel basically was falling off.

I've seen this foot scrubber a few times on TikTok, so really wanted to try it and let me tell you, it worked wonders for my feet, made them super soft and just exfoliated them really well.

Me and my mom were cracking up when we were removing it, and for the next two days, it just kept getting more and more drastic. At one point, my whole heel basically was falling off.

So my apartment did not come with a dishwasher and doing the dishes very quickly became the absolute bane of my existence. This is my dirty cup. I wanted to show a before I had an espresso in there. And then for one person, it does hold a solid amount of dishes, but the most important part for me was you don't have to hook it up to water. I would have no clue how to do that. It comes with a jug. Also comes with a hose and a suction cup. Stick that shit into your sink, man. Look at that steamy water. We getting steamy. And then, ah, chef's kiss. It's so satisfying to watch. You really can't put a price on laziness because look how clean. To me, worth it.\",\n",

       "  'transcription': \" Five bathroom items you didn't know you needed. First is this dual toothpaste dispenser that's pretty cool. It holds your brushes and you just push through on this lever and it pushes the toothpaste right out onto your toothbrush. And it can hold up to five brushes unless they're electric. Then it holds a little bit less. It also comes with four cups, two on the bottom and two on the top. I've seen this foot scrubber a few times on TikTok, so really wanted to try it and let me tell you, it worked wonders for my feet, made them super soft and just exfoliated them really well. We all know the struggle of running low on toothpaste and trying to use every last bit in the tube. So this device you can just twist and it squeezes all the toothpaste right out. I am obsessed with this shampoo, conditioner and shower gel dispenser that you can just mount on your wall. And lastly, this silicone mat that suctions to your wall and exfoliates your entire body.\",\n",
